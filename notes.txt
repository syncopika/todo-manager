tried running `go run main.go` after doing `cobra init --pkg-name github.com/syncopika/todo-manager`
C:\Users\Nicholas\Desktop\programming\todo-manager>go run main.go
main.go:18:8: cannot find package "github.com/syncopika/todo-manager/cmd" in any of:
        c:\go\src\github.com\syncopika\todo-manager\cmd (from $GOROOT)
        C:\Users\Nicholas\go\src\github.com\syncopika\todo-manager\cmd (from $GOPATH)

the info about `go mod init` is useful.

// TODO
- use JSON pls, not plaintext lol
- when tasks are done, move them to a separate file?
- put todo.txt in a folder?
- filter tasks when requesting them? (like show only 'in progress' or 'to do')
- make tasks a little more than just a title, date and status? be able to provide
  a description as well maybe?
- prettify the output (if possible)?
